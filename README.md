# WhispServer

WhispClient is the server implementation for **Whisp**, a peer-to-peer (P2P) instant messaging application focused on privacy and functionality. 
This project originated as part of a Distributed Computing course and has evolved into a fully functional application. 
Communication is powered by **Java RMI**, with security as a key feature.
